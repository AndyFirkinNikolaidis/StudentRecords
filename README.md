# Developer Technical Assessment


**Andreas Nikolaidis submission**

**Project contents**

- Shared class library
- Blazor hosted web project for a front-end management of student records
- Web Api project to read and write from json files (json files moved to this project for ease of access - I hope this is OK)
- A unit test project (I am still new to unit testing and eager to develop these skills so I appreciate they may not follow best practice)

** Improvements that should be made in production or if I had more time **
- Refactoring of some of the logic around Ids of course assignments and student Id
- Improvements to unit testing
- I have had to make some assumtions about some properties of the objects (Course assignment details etc)
- Validation of the models in blazor needs some work
- Removal of course assigments was not in the scope of the requirements but would be useful


Please let me know if there are any difficultioes running the project
